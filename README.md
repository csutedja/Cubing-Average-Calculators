# Cubing Average Calculators



_Simple program to calculate Rubik's cube averages (mo3/ao5/ao12), written in Python._

# Instructions
1. Run main.py. The program will ask you whether you want to calculate a mean of 3, average of 5, or average of 12. 
2. Once you have selected a average style, input your times, seperating each one by using the enter key.
3. Once you have all your times inputted, the program will calculate your average and output it. (Outputs will be rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second, per <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9f1">WCA Regulation 9f1</a>)

# Coming soon:

- the ability to calculate a custom average of the user's choosing (ao25, ao15, mo5, etc)
