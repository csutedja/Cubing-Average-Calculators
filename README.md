# Cubing Averages Calculator



_Simple program to calculate Rubik's cube averages (mo3/ao5/ao12), written in Python._

**To use:**
1. Run main.py. The program will ask you whether you want to calculate a mean of 3, average of 5, or average of 12. 
2. Once you have selected a average style, input your times, seperating each one by using the enter key.
3. Once you have all your times inputted, the program will calculate your average and output it. (Outputs will be rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second, per <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9f1">WCA Regulation 9f1</a>)

**To-do:**
 - the ability to restart the program once an average is calculated if the user wants to
 - ~~error checking: currently if any value besides an integer/float is entered, the program will crash~~ _Error checking is now handled properly in version 2.0!_
 ~~- capability to calculate mo3 and ao12, two other common cubing solve stats~~ _Newly added in version 2.0!_
